### eucWatch:
This is a fork of Enaon's great work. Generally I will do customizations for myself. I'll also share the Espruino builds here. Maybe you can find something useful.

>**Notice**:
>There are two problems one might face when buying a P8 watch to use with this git. 
>1. The antenna of the p8 might not be good enouph for a solid connection. It will work, but only 3 out of 10 that I got my hand on were good enough to not need an antenna change. That requires opening up the watch, and if done carefully it barelly leaves any visible marks.
>2. Some watches, version TON5, are mising a crystal, that makes them currently incompatible with daFlasher. They can still be flashed, but that requires opening up the watch.

### Loader version:

[**Web loader**](https://ysfsvm.github.io/eucWatch/p8)  for the P8 watch
[**Testing Web loader**](https://ysfsvm.github.io/eucWatch/p8-dev)  for the P8 watch
[**Dev Web loader**](https://ysfsvm.github.io/eucWatch/p8-testing)  for the P8 watch

[**Web loader**](https://ysfsvm.github.io/eucWatch/dk08) for the DK08 watch

#### Espruino Installation [how-to] - Espruino Images - Useful Files [here](https://ysfsvm.github.io/eucWatch/p8_hack-files/)

[Espruino](https://www.espruino.com/) and sdk12 upgrade image by @fanoush. 

**Enter this in left hand side (webide) to enable flash(one time only) before uploading.** 
(the loader version will do this automatically when an install option from the installer tab is selected)

var spi=new SPI();spi.setup({sck:D2,mosi:D3,miso:D4,mode:0}); spi.send([0xab],D5);  //wake


### Credits

@ATC1441, who made over the air hacking of the P8 watch possible. He wrote the [DaFlasher](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.atcnetz.paatc.patc&gl=US) playstore app to make the proccess easy. He also made the adruino based [ATCWatch](https://github.com/atc1441/ATCwatch) custom firmware to run on the P8 watch.
**More info on DaFlasher [here](https://github.com/atc1441/DaFlasherFiles)**


@Fanoush, who makes the Espruino builds/bootloader and shares his knowledge. Among other things, he wrote the [inline c screen/spi-flash shared bus driver](https://gist.github.com/fanoush/3dede6a16cef85fbf55f9d925521e4a0) used in this project, and made an sdk12 bootloader to support secure BLE connections.

@gfwilliams, who is the man behind Espruino. This project uses the Espruino [app loader](https://github.com/espruino/EspruinoApps) and many code snippets from [bangle.js](https://github.com/espruino/BangleApps) source code.
