## Install espruino on the P8 smart watch:

### Before installation:
You will need an android smartphone, and the [DaFlasher](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.atcnetz.paatc.patc&hl=el&gl=US) app from the playstore, made by atc1441.

Using the app, you will upload four files to the P8 watch:

1. a custom app that will replace the bootloader of the p8.
2.  a  bootloader.
3.   yet another  bootloader, this time compatible with the espruino image linked bellow.
4. finally the espruino image itself.

When step three ends, the watch will reboot to a blank screen, ready for the final step. 

Go back or kill/start Daflasher. and this time look for a device called dfutarg, this is the p8 now. 

>**Step 4.**

Select it, and this time do not chose the **Use Nordic Bootloader** option. Then press the **Select DFU file** button, and choose the file step4-xxx. 

This step will take up to 5 minutes, and when done the watch will remain blank. 

### EucWatch Installation:

If all went ok disconnect the phone by turning off the BT radio, so that you will make sure the watch is disconnected, and go to the eucWatch [loader](https://ysfsvm.github.io/eucWatch/p8) , press the **connect** button on the right top corner, connect to the p8 (named p8xxx), then on the installer tab select **feature set/all**. 

Select 716 and scl for the touch and accelerometer if not sure, they can be later re-selected by uploading just the handler file. 

good luck :)

### Return to atcDfu (sdk11):

Simply flash `sdk12-to-sdk11.zip` from daFlasher or nrfconnect.
